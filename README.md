For our project we have decided to use a mixture of containers such as Docker and cloud services such as AWS Lambda to create containerized services where token are required to run these services. We created a simple text-based hangman game where user guesses the mystery key word by guessing letters that fill out the characters of the word in the string with a set amount of tries. This program acts as the primary service and a user must "pay" for this service by requesting a token from AWS and validating it against another containerized service. Please see file "CPS831-W19-projectreport-Zhou-Sirois" for IEEE paper.
